### Anna Bernbaum's Sensing and IoT Project Coursework for Design Engineering at Imperial College London Year 4

The project is broken into Coursework 1 and Coursework 2:
- Coursework 1 Sensing: Run LightSensor.py to collect Light Data using a BH1750 Light Sensor. Run TwitterAPI.py to collect Tweets. The Bash script was used to upload the collected data onto Box from a RPi.
- Coursework 2 IoT: Run main.py to launch the LightDogs web app.
